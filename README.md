# Football_Prediction_Interactive_Dashboard
This project is an interactive Excel dashboard designed for football match analysis and score prediction. Using mathematical methods and the Poisson distribution, the dashboard calculates probabilities for different outcomes, offering detailed insights into team performance. 

The dashboard features sections for data input, predictions, and graphical analysis. Simply input historical match statistics for home and away form, and the system will generate predictions for future matches. The visual representations in the dashboard make it easy to interpret the data and results intuitively. Additionally, the file contains automated macros to streamline calculations, ensuring a smooth user experience.

To use the dashboard, make sure you have Microsoft Excel (2016 or later recommended) and enable macros for full functionality. Navigate through the predefined sheets, input your data, and explore the calculated predictions and visual analyses. The methodology is built on the Poisson distribution, which is widely used for predicting football scores based on historical performance metrics.

I am always open to suggestions for improving the project or adding new features. If you have any feedback or ideas, feel free to contact me at balanalexandru1111@gmail.com. Thank you for exploring this project, and I hope you find it both useful and insightful!
